# Ruby provides a whole set of I/O related methods in the Kernel module.
# A Ruby module is like a Java interface.

# The print method prints each parameter its passeed to standard out (stdout).
# It does not append a new line to the end of its output.
print "cat", [1,2,3], 99, "\n"
print "cat", [1,2,3], 99, "\n"

# Observations: The argument to the print method weren't enclosed in parenthesis.
# Delimiters like the semi-colon weren't needed at the end of the lines of code.
